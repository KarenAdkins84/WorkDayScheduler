# WorkDayScheduler

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Languages
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Jquery
Bootstrap
Moment.js

## Description
I displayed the current time and date using Moment.js.
I used javascript to determine what hours on the calendar were in the past, present, or future.
I added timeblocks to the HTML with corresponding classes and ids to work with the starter CSS.
I used local storage to store the user's input for each hour and print it to the page.
